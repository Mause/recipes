## Crunchy Witch Cake (Anita's Recipe)

### Ingredients

 * 250ml full cream
 * 1 egg
 * 180 grams sugar
 * 4 desert spoons chocolate powder
 * 50 grams dark chocolate (chopped)
 * 100 grams ground hazelnuts
 * 190 grams flour
 * 1 teaspoon baking powder
 * 1 pinch salt

## Method

1. Preheat over to 160 degrees
2. Mix cream, egg, and sugar together well in bowl
3. Add dark chocolate, chocolate powder
4. Mix together ground hazelnuts, flour, baking powder and salt in separate bowl, then add to previous mixture
5. Pour mixture in cake form
6. Chop up a handful of extra hazelnuts and spread over the mixture
7. Bake for 50/55 minutes, keeping an eye on it: hazelnuts burn easy, so you may need to cover with alfoil.

This makes a small cake, double if needed and cook a little longer.
